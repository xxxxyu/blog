In Amodei’s vision, the powerful AI, which is similar to today’s LLMs in form, but not necessarily the same in implementation, has the following properties in my summarization:\n\nSuper intelligent. It is “smarter than a Nobel Prize winner” in terms of pure intelligence. For example, it can prove unsolved mathematical theorems and write extremely good novels.\nWorks with interfaces. It has all the “interfaces” a human would require to work virtually with, other than just chatting.\nAutonomous. It can autonomously solve given tasks for a long period, with only necessary clarification from human.\nInteracts virtually. It doesn’t have a physical embodiment, but can control (and even create) physical tools through a computer.\nMassive amount and high speed. It has abundant resources (repurposed from training) for massive deployment (e.g., millions of instances), and learns and generates actions much faster than human (e.g., by 10-100×).\nIndependent yet cooperative. The millions of instances can work both independently on unrelated tasks, and cooperatively on one task, with some of them fine-tuned to be especially good at particular tasks (I would call them experts).\n\nHe summarizes this as a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”, which is principally capable of solving very difficult problems very fast, but still limited by several factors from the real world. For example, speed of the outside world, need for data (e.g., in particle physics), intrinsic complexity (e.g., the three-body problem), constraints from humans (e.g., by laws and people’s willingness), and physical laws (this even limits the density of the digital world by limiting number of transistors per square centimeter and minimum energy per bit erased).\nTherefore, he proposes that we should be talking about “the marginal returns to intelligence”, which is borrowed from the economic term, to conceptualize a world with very powerful AI.\nAnd all his visions are based on this, with awareness of in what areas, to what extent, and on what timescale does very powerful AI helps.\nThis is a refreshing idea to me — we could easily end up with either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic imaginations without a reasonable measurement of the impact of intelligence.\nThe above basic assumptions and framework[2], although not the main part of Machines of Loving Grace, impress me the most.\nAfter all, the hardest thing is not to infer a reasonable answer given a solid framework, but to propose the framework.\nHe spends the rest of the essay to elaborate on what would happen 5-10 years after the powerful AI comes, in five main aspects: biology and health, neuroscience and mind, economic development and poverty, peace and governance, work and meaning.\nIn short, his basic prediction is that powerful AI will allow us to compress the progress that human would have achieved over the next 50-100 years into 5-10 years, which he refers to as the “compressed 21st century”. The question is when will that powerful AI actually come.\nIn contrast to the Basic assumptions and framework section, i think some points in the prediction sections, for example, the “liberal democracy vs. authoritarianism” part[3], are rather personal.\nIt is clear that even within the same analytical framework, different people would have different understanding and imagination on certain issues, based on their unique background and characteristics.\nThat’s an important reason why I like to read stuffs by people of different backgrounds, and now I am attempting to keep notes.\nMechanistic Interpretability for Safe AI\nAs modern AI becomes more and more powerful, towards the “powerful AI” vision discussed above, the question of how to govern powerful AI and ensure it’s safe is gaining increasing importance (and the definition of safety is another big question).\nTechnically, some safety mechanisms must be developed for a powerful AI system in the future (when it becomes powerful enough), and interpretability is definitely one of the most important aspects for safety control.\nIn The Urgency of Interpretability, Amodei discusses the importance and history of mechanistic interpretability, and Anthropic’s recent progress on this.\nIn my understanding, the reason why interpretability is so important is that unlike conventional systems, which are programed in a definite manner, modern AI (i.e., AI based on deep neural networks) is mostly a blackbox — even people who trained them cannot have a 100% (sometimes not even 1%) clear understanding of why and how they produce certain outputs against some inputs.\nAs Amodei quoted from Chris Olah, his co-founder, generative AI systems are “grown” (I like this word) more than they are “built” — their internal mechanisms are emergent rather than directly designed.\nUnfortunately, it is very possible that such “blackbox” (for now) systems will have increasingly huge impact on us humans, until one day it must be transparent and interpretable enough for more various applications.\nBack to mechanistic interpretability, it is a field of reverse-engineering neural networks to understand the specific algorithms and computational mechanisms they learn to implement internally.\nDifferent from other interpretability approaches that focus on input-output relationships or high-level model behavior, mechanistic interpretability seeks detailed, mechanistic understanding of the system at low level (e.g., in layers and neurons).\nIt was first studied on CNNs, and now LLMs.\nChris Olah, co-founder of Anthropic, has been working on this field since he was at Google and OpenAI.\nGiven the example of a LLM, the first step is to find single interpretable neurons[4], and then they found that while some neurons were immediately interpretable, the vast majority were an incoherent pastiche of many different words and concepts, which allows the model to express more concepts than it has neurons. They referred to this phenomenon as superposition. To interpret the more complicated superpositions, they adopted a signal-processing-inspired method called sparse autoencoders[5], with which they were able to find combinations of neurons that did correspond to cleaner, more human-understandable concepts (even very subtle ones like the concept of “literally or figuratively hedging or hesitating”), which they call features. They were able to find over 30 million features in Claude 3 Sonnet, Anthropic’s medium-sized commercial model, through this method.\nMore could be done to understand the model’s working mechanism after finding the features. For example, artificially amplifying neurons related to a feature would significantly affect the model’s behavior (“Golden State Claude”); tracking and manipulating groups of features (i.e., circuits[6]) could help to understand the model’s reasoning process.\nAnthropic’s research blogs [7] introduce these progresses in more details.\nI appreciate the idea of mechanistic interpretability to “reverse engineer” deep neural networks, including modern LLMs with billions of parameters, as it provides valuable insights about how the AI models works inside.\nIt seems on a right track but I doubt if it is the ultimate path towards powerful and safe AI, to catch “bugs” inside a huge neural network — it would be like eliminating cancer cells of a blue whale.\nAt least for now, I think our models are still not powerful enough to be “dangerous” — and sure mechanistic interpretability also helps improve this.\nAI and Politics\nThis is a TODO section (also too large a topic to discuss) — I’ll complete this part when time allows.\n\n\nI started from an Chinese article summarizing On DeepSeek and Export Controls. Then I read the original English post, and other posts from Amodei’s homepage afterwards. ↩\n\n\nThese are summarized from the Basic assumptions and framework section of the original post. ↩\n\n\n“Twenty years ago US policymakers believed that free trade with China would cause it to liberalize as it became richer; that very much didn’t happen, and we now seem headed for a second cold war with a resurgent authoritarian bloc.” — In the first paragraph of Peace and governance section. ↩\n\n\nElhage, Nelson, et al. “Softmax Linear Units.” Transformer Circuits Thread, 27 June 2022, https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html. ↩\n\n\nBricken, Trenton, et al. “Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning.” Transformer Circuits Thread, 4 Oct. 2023, https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features. ↩\n\n\nLindsey, Jack, et al. “On the Biology of a Large Language Model.” Transformer Circuits Thread, 27 Mar. 2025, https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html. ↩\n\n\nMapping the Mind of a Large Language Model, and Tracing the thoughts of a large language model ↩\n\n\n","description":"Reading Notes of Dario Amodei's Blog.","id":"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/amodei-blog-reading-notes/","path":"/posts/amodei-blog-reading-notes/","title":"Reading Notes of Dario Amodei's Blog"},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/":{"body":"A serie of cheatsheets for my development on various edge devices.\n","description":"","id":"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/","path":"/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/","title":"Edge Development Cheatsheet"},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/pi-setup-cheatsheet/":{"body":"This is mostly based on my personal development requirements.

I divide recent progress of VLA into 4 quadrants:\n\nIn the following of this section, I’ll introduce these categories respectively.\nDiscrete VLA\nDiscrete VLA generates discrete action tokens. Specifically, it adopts discrete action tokenization that maps low-level robot actions to discrete tokens, and trains the VLM to generate such tokens autoregressively, just like generating text tokens.\nThis provides a straightforward approach to align the two modalities, action and language, which simplifies the training based on autoregressive VLMs (i.e., from next token prediction to next action prediction).\nHowever, it suffers from high latency and low FPS in robot control, since the autoregressive generation paradigm needs to go through the entire VLA for each forward pass.\nSome representative methods:\n\nRT-2[1] (ViT + PALI-X/PALM-E): a pioneer work that proposes and popularizes the term “VLA”.\nOpenVLA[2] (DinoV2 &amp; SigLIP + Llama2 7B): an influential open-source VLA model (3.8k stars on GitHub).\nFAST[3]: an action tokenizer that compresses action sequences with DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).\n\nContinuous VLA\nContinuous VLA samples from a continuous action space, which allows smoother control with higher precision, but also increases the difficulty of training atop existing language models.\nTo solve this, Physical Intelligence first proposes to integrate a flow-matching (a variant of diffusion) action expert to a pre-trained VLM, and trains $\\pi_0$[4] atop a pre-trained PaliGemma 2B VLM.\nThe insight is to 1) utilize the VLM pre-trained on internet-scale datasets for semantic understanding and generalization, and 2) utilize the flow-matching action expert trained on cross-embodiment datasets for high-frequency (up to 50Hz) control policy. It also allows optional post-training fine-tuning for difficult or unseen tasks.\n\nSimilarly, NVIDIA Isaac trains GR00T N1(.5)[5] that combines an pre-trained Eagle-2 VLM and an diffusion-based action head, which is the first foundation model for generalist humanoid robots. In both $\\pi_0$ and GR00T, the VLM backbone and action expert communicates through attention modules, so that the generated actions are conditioned on the hidden states (i.e., KV) of the VLM. Still, there are two technical differences:\n\nAttention mechanism: $\\pi_0$ concatenates the VL and action KV and conducts masked self-attention (a blog illustrates this clearly); GR00T directly conducts cross-attention between the two parts.\nNumber of VLM layers involved: $\\pi_0$ aligns the number of layers in the action expert to the VLM backbone, and conducts self-attention in each layer (MoE-like); GR00T only keeps the hidden states of the last layer in the VLM[6], and conducts cross-attention with it for each layer.\n\nDual-System VLA\nDifferent from earlier works that use a separate LLM/VLM as the task planner (i.e., system-1-only VLA), dual-system VLA utilize the VLM backbone in VLA as the task planner, so the system 2 (high-level planning) and system 1 (low-level control policy) shares one VLM.\nThis further enhances open-world generalization of the VLA, by learning to predict subtasks from user instructions by itself.\nBesides, it reduces the resource requirements compared to using a separate task planner model.\n\nQuestion: does it also help improve model performance, as the system 1 and 2 are better aligned? On the other hand, does this cause potential interference between different objectives?\n\n\n$\\pi_{0.5}$[7] is the first of this category, trained by Physical Intelligence. Compared to $\\pi_0$, it involves new training data, including object detection, instructions &amp; subtask commands, discrete actions, etc.\nAt inference time, it first predicts low-level command from high-level prompt with the VLM (system 2), then executes the low-level command with the VLM and action expert (system 1).\nThis paradigm (training recipe and inference scheme) is followed by recent VLA like G0[8] by Galaxea and WALL-OSS[9] by X Square Robot.\nWhile most of these models are continuous VLA, WALL-OSS also includes a discrete version with FAST tokenization (WALL-OSS-FAST).\nTheir repositories and open-source states:\n\n$\\pi_{0.5}$: Weights opened. Code partially opened at Physical-Intelligence/openpi. Inference code for the VLM subtask prediction is not opened.\nG0: Weights and open-world dataset opened. Code partially opened at OpenGalaxea/G0. Currently only support real-robot inference.\nWALL-OSS: Weights and code opened at X-Square-Robot/wall-x.\n\nSummary and Future Look\nIn the past 3 years (from RT-2 in 2023), VLA has rapidly evolved from discrete to continuous, and from single-system to dual-system.\nIn the following years, I personally think native multi-tasking will be another trend of VLA (I will probably write another post) — embodied agents should be capable of performing multiple fundamentally different tasks (e.g., chat, memory, navigation) instead of restricted to “action”.\nAs introduced above, recent models are already sharing the Internet-scale pre-trained VLM backbone for task planning and control policy (though still restricted to action tasks), which lays the foundation for more aggressive model sharing (one VLM backbone for multiple tasks) as a step forward in the future.\nI am currently working on building this multi-expert foundation model for native multi-tasking of embodied agents — feel free to contact for discussion and collaboration!\n\n\nZitkovich, Brianna, et al. “RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control.” Conference on Robot Learning.

While vLLM doesn’t raise explicit errors when loading such models, it incorrectly treats them as GPTQv1 format, resulting in degraded inference quality and characteristic gibberish outputs (consisting of repeated !!!, details in this issue).\nThis limitation stems from differences in zero point handling between GPTQv1 and GPTQv2 checkpoint formats, which vLLM’s existing GPTQ GeMM kernels don’t account for. This post presents a comprehensive analysis of this limitation, and documents the implementation of kernel adaptations (i.e., in this PR), that enable proper GPTQv2 support while maintaining backward compatibility.\nThrough careful investigation of vLLM’s quantization support and targeted CUDA kernel modifications, I enable robust inference for GPTQv2 format models, especially low-bit or asymmetric ones, with vLLM — contributing a step forward towards efficient LLM deployment.\nBackground and Preliminaries\nIn my case, I use vLLM to serve some low-bit (e.g., 2-bit), asymmetrically quantized models, stored in GPTQv2 format, and encountered this issue.\nBefore diving into technical details, I’ll briefly introduce the background to do so (e.g., why GPTQv2), and some preliminaries (e.g., the checkpoint format) to help follow the technical parts. Key takeaways:\n\nAsymmetric quantization benefits low-bit quantization, by adjusting the zero point for each group of weights.\nGPTQv2 format outperforms GPTQv1 in asymmetric quantization, by better preserving zero point information.\n\nWeight Quantization of LLMs\nWeight quantization that quantizes high-precision model weights (e.g., 16/32-bit) into fewer bits (e.g., 2/3/4/8-bit) has been a common practice in LLM deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.\nTechnically, weight quantization maps the large range of high-precision weights (e.g., within $[-65504, 65504]$ for FP16) into a limited range of quantized weights (e.g., $[0, 2^b - 1]$ for $b$-bit unsigned integer).\nThis mapping typically involves a scaling factor ($scale$) that compresses the range, and a bias ($zero$) that shifts the zero point. We denote $w_o$ as the original weight within the range $[w_{min}, w_{max}]$ (usually for a group of weights), and $w_q$ as the quantized weight. Then, a simple $b$-bit integer quantization is formulated as:\n\\[\nscale = \\frac{w_{max} - w_{min}}{2^b - 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nzero = - \\mathrm{round}(\\frac{w_{min}}{scale})\n\\]\n\\[\nw_q = \\mathrm{clamp}(\\mathrm{round}(\\frac{w_o}{scale}) + zero)\n\\]\nTo recover the original weight $\\hat{w}_o$ during dequantization:\n\\[\n\\hat{w}_o = (w_q - zero) \\cdot scale\n\\]\nBased on this formulation, quantization methods are categorized by whether the zero point is required:\n\n\nSymmetric quantization assumes $w_{max} = - w_{min}$, so $zero = - \\mathrm{round}(\\frac{2^b - 1}{2})$ will not change. In this case, $zero$ doesn’t provide additional information given the quantization bits.\n\n\nAsymmetric quantization doesn’t have such assumption. So $zero$ varies across groups of weights, and is necessary for accurately recovering the original weights.\n\n\nNote that most GPTQ implementations are 4-bit symmetric quantization. However, to reduce the quantization error in lower bits, asymmetric quantization is necessary.\nGPTQ: Quantization and Checkpoint Format\nGPTQ[1] is one of the most popular post-training quantization methods for generative transformers (mainly LLMs and VLMs).\nIt utilizes approximate second-order information (inverse layer Hessian) to reduce quantization errors.\nBesides, GPTQ could also refer to the specific checkpoint format adopted by GPTQ-quantized models (e.g., by AutoGPTQ), with details explained in this blog.\nGPTQ is widely supported by the community, including 1) quantization libraries that implement the GPTQ quantization method or support exporting to GPTQ format (although not implementing the quantization method), and 2) kernel libraries and inference frameworks that support inference with models of the GPTQ checkpoint format, as listed below:\nQuantization libraries:\n\nGPTQModel is now the 1st choice for GPTQ quantization in replacement of AutoGPTQ, with richer model and backend support.\nAutoGPTQ was the most popular library for GPTQ quantization, and is unmaintained now.\ngptq is the official code implementation of the GPTQ paper.\nMany other libraries implement GPTQ quantization, or support to save quantized models in GPTQ format.\n\nComputing (CUDA) kernels:\n\nMarlin is the SOTA W4A16 mpGeMM kernel supporting 4-bit GPTQ models.\nExLlamaV2 is an inference library with high-performance kernels for GPTQ models.\nBitBLAS is a high-performance low-bit mpGeMM kernel library supporting GPTQ models.\nSimilarly, many other kernel libraries support GPTQ format models.\n\nSOTA LLM inference frameworks, including vLLM, are integrated with the above quantization and kernel libraries, to support efficient LLM deployment with GPTQ quantization.\nFrom GPTQv1 to GPTQv2\nGPTQv2 is an upgraded version of GPTQ (by a different team though), in both the quantization method and checkpoint format. Specifically:\n\nQuantization method: GPTQv2 (also called GPTAQ) introduces asymmetric calibration, which effectively reduces the quantization error accumulated in previous layers[2]. It’s first implemented in GPTAQ, and then integrated to GPTQModel (enabled by setting v2=True).\nCheckpoint format: GPTQv2 format stores the zero points differently with GPTQv1 (i.e., GPTQ) format — GPTQv1 stores $\\mathrm{clamp}(zero - 1)$ in the checkpoint, and requires adding $1$ back before dequantization at runtime[3]. GPTQv2 stores the exact $zero$ value, and doesn’t require extra runtime adjustment. It is also supported by GPTQModel (enabled by setting format=\"gptq_v2\").\n\nJust like GPTQv1, the quantization method and checkpoint format are not coupled. So you can:\n\nStore a non-GPTQ-quantized model in GPTQv2 format, like BitDistiller/Qwen-8B-w2g64-gptq.\nStore a GPTQv1-quantized model in GPTQv2 format, by setting format=\"gptq_v2\" only, in GPTQModel.\nStore a GPTQv2-quantized model in GPTQv1 format, by setting v2=True only, in GPTQModel.\n\nNote that the conversion between GPTQv2 and GPTQv1 format is irreversible — you can convert GPTQv1 to GPTQv2 losslessly, but not from GPTQv2 to GPTQv1. This is due to the “-1” issue of GPTQv1 as mentioned above. In this way, the actual zero point range in suppressed by clamping $0 - 1$ to $0$ in GPTQv1. For example, in INT2 quantization, the effective range shrinks from $[0,3]$ to $[1,3]$.\nTherefore, GPTQv2 format is a preferable choice in asymmetric quantization, especially for low-bit quantization.\nCause Analysis\nAfter all the preparation, we can finally dive into the technical details about why and how vLLM fails for GPTQv2 in my case — even though it has some sort of support actually, which I found after careful investigation. Key takeaways:\n\nvLLM has several GPTQ-compatible GeMM kernels with pre-defined priorities — Marlin, BitBLAS, and fallbacks.\nPerformant kernels like Marlin support GPTQv2 format of limited bits and symmetry — only 4/8-bit symmetric quantization.\nFallback kernels support more bits and symmetry but lacks GPTQv2 format support — the reason why I encountered the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n\n\nvLLM’s Kernel Routing Hierarchy\nThe first step is to understand how vLLM routes computing kernels for different quantizations, like GPTQ. This is implemented in the model execution part of the LLMEngine. For simplicity, we only consider dense models (no MoE). It includes the following calling hierarchy:\n1. Model-level quantization configuration:\n\nIn model implementations (vllm/model_executor/models), vllm_config: VllmConfig is passed to the model at initialization, which contains quant_config: QuantizationConfig.\n\nEach quantization extends QuantizationConfig with quantization-specific overrides (e.g., GPTQConfig). See all quantizations.\nIf no quantization is specified in quant_config, ModelConfig._verify_quantization will select one from a priority list (see below).\n\n\nEach linear module of this model is initialized with quant_config.\n\n2. Layer-level quantization configuration (linear methods):\n\nAt initialization, each quantized linear module determines quant_method = quant_config.get_quant_method.\n\nget_quant_method returns a specific linear method class (inherited from LinearMethodBase, e.g., GPTQLinearMethod) depending on the quantization configuration.\n\n\nEach linear module calls the computing kernel by overriding LinearMethodBase.apply (e.g., GPTQLinearMethod.apply calls gptq_gemm).\n\n3. (Optional) Kernel selection (linear kernels):\nvLLM supports several ways of routing to low-level CUDA kernels from a linear method class:\n\nDirect calling. For example, GPTQLinearMethod directly routes to gptq_gemm, a registered custom operand of vLLM (implemented in csrc/quantization/gptq).\nIndirect calling. When multiple kernels are available for a linear method, or a kernel is available for multiple linear methods, vLLM supports extending the MPLinearKernel class as an interface for routing to this kernel (in vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/kernels/mixed_precision). For example, GPTQBitBLASLinearMethod routes to BitBLASLinearKernel, and GPTQMarlinLinearMethod calls choose_mp_linear_kernel for flexible routing.\nExternal calling (orthogonal to the above). vLLM supports calling kernels from external libraries. For example, BitBLASLinearKernel calls Matmul from the bitblas Python library.\n\nvLLM’s Support for GPTQ(v2) Format\nvLLM integrates several optimized kernels for GPTQ format models, as listed in GPTQ: Quantization and Checkpoint Format, including Marlin, ExLlamaV2, BitBLAS, etc. vLLM also has fallback kernels for unsupported quantization configurations of these kernels. Following the analysis in vLLM’s Kernel Routing Hierarchy, I summarize this support matrix (by linear methods):\nMethodBitsSymGPTQ Format\nGPTQMarlin4,8Truegptq, gptq_v2\nGPTQBitBLAS4,8Truegptq, gptq_v2\nGPTQ2,3,4,8Anygptq\n\n\nNotes:\n\nAll methods support 4/8-bit symmetric quantization. vLLM selects the most performant method supported by the current configuration, according to predefined priorities of quantization overrides (in ModelConfig._verify_quantization):\n\n\n\nOnly GPTQLinearMethod supports 2/3-bit quantization and asymmetric quantization. However, it lacks GPTQv2 support (both the other two supports).\n\nAs a result, neither 2/3-bit nor asymmetric quantization in GPTQv2 format are unsupported by vLLM, which motivates this PR.\nSolution\nBased on the above analysis, vLLM’s GPTQ linear methods lack support for 2/3-bit quantization and asymmetric quantization in GPTQv2 format, and require adaption to robustly support GPTQv2 format models of various configurations.\nApproach: Adapt GPTQ Linear Method &amp; Kernel\nTo add such support, at least one linear method should be added/adapted. To adapt existing linear methods:\n\nGPTQMarlinLinearMethod (lacking 2/3-bit and asymmetric support): It requires also modifying vLLM’s Marlin CUDA kernel, which is dedicated for 4/8-bit symmetric quantization — not a good choice.\nGPTQBitBLASLinearMethod (lacking 2/3-bit and asymmetric support): It requires modifying only the linear method/kernel (Python code), since the bitblas library itself supports the bits and sym we want — a reasonable choice, but requires the optional bitblas package to be installed.\nGPTQLinearMethod (lacking GPTQv2 format support): It requires also modifying vLLM’s gptq_gemm CUDA kernel, by only adapting the zero point handling logic — preferred.\n\nSo, the plan is to adapt GPTQLinearMethod (with GPTQConfig) and gptq_gemm to add proper GPTQv2 format support.\nDetails of Adaption: Conditioned on Format\nDuring this linear method &amp; kernel adaption, there are 3 points to keep in mind:\n\nMaintain compatibility for GPTQv1 format.\nKeep the code and binary size impact down.\nMake sure other kernels (e.g., Marlin) are not running with GPTQv2 incorrectly.\n\nIn response to Pt. 1 and 2:\n\nAdd a use_v2_format: bool attribute to GPTQLinearMethod that indicates whether checkpoint_format == \"gptq_v2\".\nAdd a bool use_v2_format argument to gptq_gemm, which accepts GPTQLinearMethod.use_v2_format as input.\nIn gptq_gemm, update the zero point handling logic to be conditioned on use_v2_format. For example:\n\n\n\nWhen testing, I found that the original gptq_gemm is buggy at 4-bit even with symmetrically quantized model of GPTQv1 format — out of scope of this PR.\n\nTo ensure Pt. 3, review vLLM’s Support for GPTQ(v2) Format — both GPTQMarlinLinearMethod and GPTQBitBLASLinearMethod are not affected, as they already support GPTQv2 format, though limited to 4/8-bit symmetric quantization.\n\nTODO: Add some performance benchmarks.\nCurrently I’ve found that 2-bit gptq_gemm is slower during decoding (GeMV) than prefilling (GeMM).\n\nConclusion\nThis post details the development of GPTQv2 format support in vLLM, which addresses a significant gap in low-bit asymmetric quantization inference with SOTA LLM inference frameworks.\nQuestions and discussions are welcomed.\nPossible future works:\n\nExtend optimized kernels (Marlin, BitBLAS) to support 2/3-bit or asymmetric quantization.\nFix the 4-bit bug in gptq_gemm.\nImprove the decoding speed with gptq_gemm.\n\n\n\nFrantar, Elias, et al. “GPTQ: Accurate Post-Training Quantization for Generative Pre-Trained Transformers.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.17323 (2022). ↩\n\n\nLi, Yuhang, et al. “GPTAQ: Efficient Finetuning-Free Quantization for Asymmetric Calibration.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.02692 (2025). ↩\n\n\nde Kok, Daniël. “GPTQ Checkpoint Format.” Daniël’s Website, 7 Aug. 2024, danieldk.eu/GPTQ-Checkpoint-Format. ↩\n\n\n","description":"Deep technical analysis of GPTQv2 format limitations in vLLM, and implementation of CUDA kernel adaptations to enable efficient low-bit/asymmetric quantization inference.","id":"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/vllm-gptqv2-support/","path":"/posts/vllm-gptqv2-support/","title":"Enhancing GPTQv2 Format Support in vLLM: Analysis and Implementation"}},"docInfo":{"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/":{"body":26,"description":0,"path":0,"title":2},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/academic/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/archive/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/poems/":{"body":11,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/poems/alcahola/":{"body":8,"description":0,"path":2,"title":1},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/poems/charlesie/":{"body":13,"description":0,"path":2,"title":1},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/poems/happy-snr/":{"body":8,"description":0,"path":3,"title":2},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/poems/new-journey/":{"body":11,"description":0,"path":3,"title":2},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/amodei-blog-reading-notes/":{"body":893,"description":5,"path":5,"title":5},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/":{"body":6,"description":0,"path":4,"title":3},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/pi-setup-cheatsheet/":{"body":429,"description":9,"path":7,"title":5},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/smartphone-setup-cheatsheet/":{"body":335,"description":6,"path":7,"title":5},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/edge-development-cheatsheet/termux-setup-cheatsheet/":{"body":216,"description":7,"path":7,"title":6},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/gpt-in-your-pocket-weekly/":{"body":531,"description":0,"path":4,"title":1},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/vla-models-review/":{"body":893,"description":11,"path":4,"title":8},"https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/posts/vllm-gptqv2-support/":{"body":1346,"description":17,"path":4,"title":7}},"length":17},"lang":"English"}
