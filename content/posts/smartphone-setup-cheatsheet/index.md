Nowadays it is quite easy to deploy open-source projects on a well-configured server, especially those in the Python ecosystem. However, it is not "that" easy if you need to setup a smartphone for development from scratch, especially for new beginners. Even an expeirenced developer might need to deal with possible exceptions. Anyway, it's always good to have a TODO list to ensure the setup process is quick and nothing is missed —— so comes this cheatsheet.

This is mostly based on my personal development requirements, which are focused on AI-related computing tasks. Specifically, I run DNNs as if the smartphone was just a Linux development board (e.g., Raspberry Pi), but with different chips and OS, which are quite similar to the Linux ones. So it might not perfectly suits you if you're more interested in App development and GUI debugging.

## First Boot

### Register

Register your new device to activate the warranty (if you are not going to root the system).

## Root the System

Root is required to obtain advanced system control (as super user).

This section continues with an OnePlus example, as it is the most root-friendly Chinese smartphone brand.

Requirements:

- ADB (Android Debug Bridge): [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
- Android OTA payload dumper: [payload-dumper-go](https://github.com/ssut/payload-dumper-go)
- System ROM: [MagiskCN](https://magiskcn.com/roms.html)
- Magisk APK: [GitHub Release](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases)

### Unlock Bootloader

1. Enter developer mode
2. OEM unlock (depends on vendors)
3. Connect to the host PC with USB debugging
4. Enter bootloader: `adb reboot bootloader`
5. Unlock bootloader: `bootloader flashing unlock`
6. On the smartphone, select "unlock the bootloader" and confirm.

### Root with Magisk

Magisk 中文网教程：<https://magiskcn.com/oneplus-init-boot>

1. On the host PC, download the matching ROM package and extract
2. Extract init_boot.img from the ROM with the payload dumper
   - Usage: `payload-dumper-go -p init_boot <extracted>/payload.bin`
3. Connect to the smartphone with USB debugging
4. Transfer init_boot.img to the smartphone's "Download" folder
5. Install Magisk app to the smartphone
6. In Magisk app, "Install" init_boot.img to obtain "magisk_patched-xxx.img"
7. Transfer "magisk_patched-xxx.img" back to the host PC
8. Enter bootloader: `adb reboot bootloader`
9. Flash the patch: `fastboot flash init_boot magisk_patched-xxx.img`
    - You should see "Okay" if it succeeds.
10. Reboot the system: `fastboot reboot`

After rebooting, enter the Magisk app and check the "Magisk" version. You should be able to see the correct version displayed after a successful rooting.

## System Setting

### Developer Option

- Turn on developer option
- Turn on USB debugging
- Turn on wireless debugging (if you prefer)

### System Update

It is recommended to turn off all settings that might influence system performance and version stability. Specifically:

- Turn off unecessary (background) services
- Turn off system auto-update and auto-download
- Remove auto-installed apps

### Battery Management

- Turn on "performance mode" in system-wide battery settings
- Turn on "allow background" in app-wise battery settings
- Select "acquire wakelock" for Termux processes and alike

## Apps

How to install:

- Install from app stores (Google Play, F-Droid, etc.)
- Install from web-downloaded APK (Android Application Package)
- Install from host PC by ADB (APK required)

### Clash for Android (CFA)

First and foremost, setup the proxy.

TODO: details

### F-Droid

F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. Use it as an alternative to Google Play.

F-Droid site: <https://f-droid.org/>

### Termux

Installation by F-Droid is recommended.

Check out the [Termux Setup Cheatsheet](https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog/articles/termux-setup-cheatsheet/).

### Microsoft Edge

Use it as an alternative to the system default browser, which often has limited functionalities.

I recommend Edge as it is the most available one (in Chinese app stores).
